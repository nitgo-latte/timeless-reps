# Timeless Reps

> Monorepo web app built on Next.js + React, Node.js, all in TypeScript. Database powered by PostgreSQL. The goal is to track user exercising sessions accurately based on units of milli-seconds. Most folks develop a habit of exercising against a fixed number of repetitions. However, time-based sessions allow one to focus on the quality of the repetition rather than reaching the number of repetitions.

## Local MVP

- [ ] Set up the Next.js + React front-end using TypeScript.
- [x] Implement a Node.js back-end that communicates with the front-end and the database.
- [x] Set up a PostgreSQL database to store user exercise session data.
- [ ] User can login using SSO (Google, Apple, Github, etc).
  - [ ] User account should be created upon SSO authentication to capture future multiple SSO profiles.
- [ ] Create a UI to allow users to start, pause, and end their exercise sessions and record the time spent.
- [ ] Create a dashboard for users to view their exercise session history and track progress.

## TODO list

- [ ] Test the application thoroughly and fix any bugs or issues that arise.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a production environment.
- [ ] Gather feedback from users and iterate on the application based on their feedback.
